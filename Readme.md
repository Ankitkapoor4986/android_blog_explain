Android Main Building Blocks

Android  system was made with the goal  to make an operating system which runs on many many different devices.

An android app consist of xml and java where an xml is mostly like a helper to set the layout,and store the strings in saperate xml file but the main xml in Android is menifest.xml which holds the permissions which are needed by App and declaration information of main building blocks

In Android Java gets compiled into .class files which are parsed and converted into .dex (Dalvik Executable Code) which gets combined with xml and forms .apk file.This .apk file runs into Dalvik
Virtual Machine.

Note: Google Introduced Dalvik because of 2 reasons
1.DVM is more efficient in terms of saving the battery
2.There will be no cost of licencing the DVM which was there when we hve to use JVM.


Following is the basic structure of Android App
